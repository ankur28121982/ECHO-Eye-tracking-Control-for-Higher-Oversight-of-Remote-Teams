**Project Title**: ECHO: Eye-tracking Control for Higher Oversight of Remote Teams

**Project Description**
ECHO utilizes eye-tracking technology to provide enhanced oversight for remote teams, aiming to improve accuracy and reduce errors in work-from-home (WFH) environments. The system monitors eye movements to detect lapses in concentration, thereby enhancing quality control and audit strategies.

**Benefits for BPO Companies and Client Satisfaction**
Monitoring Span of Concentration
The ECHO (Eye-tracking Control for Higher Oversight) system offers BPO companies a robust tool to monitor the span of concentration among their remote workforce effectively. By tracking eye movements in real-time, the system provides insights into employees' engagement levels and attention spans during critical tasks.

**Key Benefits**
**Enhanced Oversight**_: BPO companies can gain real-time visibility into employees' focus and concentration levels. This allows them to identify instances of distraction or reduced attention, enabling proactive interventions to maintain productivity and quality standards.
**Error Reduction**: Early detection of lapses in concentration through eye movement analysis helps mitigate potential errors before they escalate. This proactive approach minimizes the likelihood of mistakes in client interactions or task handling, thereby improving overall service quality.
**Operational Efficiency**: By optimizing oversight through ECHO, BPO companies can streamline operations and ensure efficient resource utilization. This contributes to smoother workflow management and enhances operational resilience, especially in dynamic work environments.
**Client Satisfaction**: Consistent monitoring of concentration spans ensures that employees maintain high levels of engagement and accuracy in client interactions. This leads to improved service delivery, meeting or exceeding client expectations, and fostering long-term client satisfaction.

**Client-Centric Approach**
**Quality Assurance**: ECHO enables BPO companies to align their quality assurance strategies with real-time data on employee focus and performance. This proactive monitoring helps maintain service excellence and adherence to service level agreements (SLAs), bolstering client trust and satisfaction.
**Personalized Service**: Insights from ECHO allow BPO companies to tailor their support based on employees' concentration patterns. This personalized approach ensures that client queries are handled efficiently, enhancing overall service delivery and client retention.


**Quick Steps to Run the Eye Tracking:**
Save the Python file (e.g., echo_eye_tracking.py) in a directory/folder.
Run the script to monitor eye movements:
bash
Copy code
python echo_eye_tracking.py
Eye movement data will be logged in "eye_movement_log.txt".

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
OpenCV
dlib

**Instructions**
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ankur28121982/ECHO-Eye-tracking-Control-for-Higher-Oversight-of-Remote-Teams

**Navigate to the project directory:**
cd echo-eye-tracking

**Install the required libraries:**
pip install opencv-python-headless dlib

**Run the script to monitor eye movements:**
python echo_eye_tracking.py


**Interpreting Eye Movement Log Data**
The log file generated by the eye-tracking script contains entries with timestamps and eye movement data. Each line in the log file follows the format:

Timestamp, UserName, X-coordinate, Y-coordinate, Movement Degree

**Understanding Log Entries**
**Timestamp**: Indicates the date and time when the eye movement was recorded in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
**UserName**: The name of the user being monitored. Replace YourUserName with the actual user name used during execution.
**X-coordinate**, Y-coordinate: The coordinates of the eye center on the screen at the recorded timestamp. These coordinates represent the position where the eye was detected.
**Movement Degree**: Indicates the degree of movement detected from the previous recorded position. It quantifies the change in eye position between consecutive frames.

Example Log Entries
2024-07-08 14:03:38, YourUserName, 281.83, 239.83, 0.75
2024-07-08 14:03:53, YourUserName, 289.33, 268.17, 3.00

**How to Use the Log Data**
**Timestamp Analysis**: Review timestamps to understand the timeline of eye movement events. This can help in identifying patterns or instances of prolonged eye movement or lack thereof.
**Coordinate Analysis**: Examine X and Y coordinates to visualize the position of the eye on the screen. This helps in understanding where the user's focus was directed during each recorded instance.
**Movement Degree**: Evaluate the movement degree to quantify the intensity of eye movement between consecutive readings. Higher values indicate more significant shifts in eye position, potentially indicating distractions or shifts in focus.


**Benefits for Oversight and Error Reduction**
**Early Detection**: Detecting abnormal eye movements can provide early indications of lapses in concentration, aiding in proactive intervention to prevent errors.
**Accuracy and Efficiency**: By monitoring eye movements, ECHO facilitates enhanced oversight, ensuring WFH employees maintain focus and efficiency during critical tasks.
